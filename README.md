# Approximation of the Meudon PDR astrophysical model using neural networks.


## About

Neural network based model approximation ``nnbma`` is a Python package that handle the creation and the training of deep neural networks to approximate astrophysical models.

For tips on how to get started with ``nnbma``, see the section [Getting started](#gettingstarted) further below.


## Installation

### Dependencies

You will need the following packages to import and use `nnbma`. We list the version of each package which we know to be compatible with `nnbma`.
